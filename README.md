# JStyle

JStyle is a style engine for iOS. Traditionally, we'd have to embed all our images in our main bundle, or load them from a network resource. Sometimes both of those options suck. JStyle works by managing a property list with keys and values. We refer to keys as **scopes**. Access to specific resources is governed by these scopes.

For instance, if we want to load a color, and we know it's scope name is `color.home.background`, then we can use some code like this:

    UIColor* backgroundColor = [[VStyle style] colorForScope:@"home.background"];

or alternatively, if you're in a `UIViewController` which implements the `JStyleService` protocol, we'll use the `-[YourViewController serviceName]` method to make accessing scopes a bit nicer. For instance:

    UIColor* backgroundColor = [[self style] colorForScope:@"background"];

In the latter form, the `-[UIViewController style]` you can get this in the `UIViewController+JStyle.h` header included in the repository.

The same pattern can be produced for `pattern`, which loads an image and returns a UIColor instance. If the pattern image cannot be found, but there exists a scope that starts with "color" instead of "pattern" but is otherwise identical, we'll return that instead. For instance, if you have a pattern scope like **pattern.home.background** and that image it references cannot be found, but there exists a **color.home.background** key, we'll use that colour instead.

Additionally, you can use `image` and `font` prefixes to scopes, and the associated method calls to return a `UIImage` or a `UIFont` instance.

## Installation

You can use submodules, if you want, copy the source tree into your repo if you want, but I strongly suggest that once you've figured out how to include the code in yours, you set up a workspace, or drag this project file into yours, adding a dependency on `libJStyle.a` in your link library build phase.
